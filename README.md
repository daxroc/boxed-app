## Automation is key...

Automated pull requests are issued from branch develop to master via Codeship
this is achieved using a custom script. This pull request requires manual 
approval to make it into the master branch. 

A sucessful build of the master branch will trigger Codeship to deploy in a 
Continious Deployment pattern.

This is an experiment into the integration with Codeship with the goal of 
Continious Delivery.
